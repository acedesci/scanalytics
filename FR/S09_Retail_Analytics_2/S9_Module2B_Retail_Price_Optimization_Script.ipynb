Unlike the explicit model in which we need to explicitly add each complete equation one by one, we can automate the model generation process by using a script version of it. For this one, we do not expect that you understand in detail how to generate the script but simply understand what each block does. Creating the script would require some experience. The main purpose of this is to provide an example of real-life mathematical programming workflow which automate the prescriptive analytics process.\n",
