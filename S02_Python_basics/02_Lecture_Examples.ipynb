This model is particularly useful when a new product will be introduced to the market. In this model, the number of adoptions ($D$) is described by $D = M\\times f(t)$ where $M$ is the market size (the total number of potential customers, which is typically given) and $f(t)$ is the probability that an individual customer makes a purchase for the product at time $t$ (which needs to be calculated).\n",

Consequently, we can also write $f(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}F(t)$. Also, the value $1 - F(t)$ represents the probability that an individual has not yet adopted (bought) the product at time $t$.\n",

These values $p$ and $q$ are used by marketers/planners to describe the behavior of the customer base. In practice, values of $p$ and $q$ are estimated using a regression technique applied to the similar products already sold in the market (thus, the data is already available). Thus, we assume that $p$ and $q$ are already available for the calculation.\n",
