        "Time series demand forecasting is crucial for effective supply chain management. With accurate demand forecasts, businesses can optimize inventory, improve demand planning, enhance sales forecasting, and mitigate supply chain risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "With recent development in Python and opensources, there are many simple-to-use packages such as [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) (mainly for statistical techniques), [Prophet (by Facebook)](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), [GluonTS (by Amazon)] (https://ts.gluon.ai/stable/), and many other libraries. Most libraries require a specific (but similar) data input format and processes. Thus, the most important step to use such packages is to prepare the data in the right format.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are also opensource libaries that are built upon many time-series forecasting packages and provide interfaces to many time-series algorithms such as [sktime](https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/index.html) and [darts](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/). These time-series forecasting interfaces greatly simplify forecasting with its intuitive API and diverse range of models, including classical statistical methods and modern machine learning approaches including deep-learning-based models.\n",

        "In this notebook, we will provide a simple walkthrough to the time-series analysis using darts. There is also a demo that provides more comprehensive pipelines of the forecasting processes."
