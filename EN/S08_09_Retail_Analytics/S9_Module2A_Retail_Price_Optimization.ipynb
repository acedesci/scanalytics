Looking at the price list, we can easily see that $p_{j=1}=3.0$ dollars. As we defined above, $x_{ij}=1$ when product $i$ is sold at price $j$, 0 otherwise. $\\tilde{D}_{ijk}$ is the predicted sales of product $i$ when this product is sold at price $j$ while the average price of all competing products, including product $i$, is equal to $k$. In our optimization model, $k$ is preset to 3.0 (avgPriceValue). By inputting price $p_{j}$ and average price $k$ into the predictive model we trained and saved last week, we can attain the corresponding predicted sales $\\left( \\tilde{D}_{ijk} \\right)$.
