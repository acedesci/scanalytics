        "The simple moving average assumes that the last $k$ observations are of equal importance on determining the forecast.  However, in some cases, more recent data may be more representative of current demand than older data. In such cases, we may opt to use the **weighted moving average method (WMA)**, which is also another commonly used method in technical analysis where historical data can be weighted to give greater importance to data from the most recent periods. This [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Weighted_moving_average) provides more details on this method.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Brief description of the model:** this method computes the forecast as the weighted average demand considering the $k$ most recent periods as follows:\n",
        ">\n",
        "> $$F_{t+1}=\\frac{kD_t+(k-1)D_{t-1}+(k-2)D_{t-2}+...+2D_{(t-k)+2}+D_{(t-k)+1}}{k+(k-1)+(k-2)+...+2+1}$$\n",

        "> - $F_t$: forecast for the period $t$\n",
        "> - $k$: number of recent observations used in the calculation\n",
        "> - $D_t$: demand for period $t$\n",
        "> \n",

        "> $$F_{t+1}=\\frac{kD_t+(k-1)D_{t-1}+(k-2)D_{t-2}+...+2D_{(t-k)+2}+D_{(t-k)+1}}{k(k+1)/2}$$\n",
        "> As an example, consider that the sales in January, February, March and April were 125 units, 142 units, 120 units, and 153 units, respectively. We want to forecast the demand for May using the weighted exponential method with $k=3$. Then the denominator will be $=3(3+1)/2 = 6$  (or $3 + 2 +1 = 6$). The forecast is computed as $F_{May}=\\frac{3D_{April}+2D_{March}+1D_{Feb}}{6}=140.167 \\approx 140$\n",
        ">\n",
        ">The advantage of weighted moving average method is that it reflects upward or downward trends more quickly (because recent data have more weight).\n",

        "Create a function which computes the forecast for the next period using the weighted moving average method, given a list of historical data and weighting factors. This function must also include the following components. \n",
        "* **Error checking**: It must return the message `'Error: not enough data'` in case that the number of observations in the historical data is less than the number of lookback periods $k$. **Hint:** you can use the `'len()` function.\n",
