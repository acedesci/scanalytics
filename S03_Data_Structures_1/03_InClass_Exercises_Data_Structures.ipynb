        "The simple moving average assumes that the last $k$ observations are of equal importance on determining the forecast.  However, in some cases, more recent data may be more representative of current demand than older data. In such cases, we may opt to use the **weighted moving average method (WMA)**, which is also another commonly used method in technical analysis where historical data can be weighted to give greater importance to data from the most recent periods. This [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Weighted_moving_average) provides more details on this method.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Brief description of the model:** this method computes the forecast as the weighted average demand considering the $k$ most recent periods as follows:\n",
        ">\n",
        "> $$F_{t+1}=\\frac{kD_t+(k-1)D_{t-1}+(k-2)D_{t-2}+...+2D_{(t-k)+2}+D_{(t-k)+1}}{k+(k-1)+(k-2)+...+2+1}$$\n",

        "> - $F_t$: forecast for the period $t$\n",
        "> - $k$: number of recent observations used in the calculation\n",
        "> - $D_t$: demand for period $t$\n",
        "> \n",
        "> We can also see that the denominator is equal to $k(k+1)/2$. Thus, we can also write:\n",
        "> $$F_{t+1}=\\frac{kD_t+(k-1)D_{t-1}+(k-2)D_{t-2}+...+2D_{(t-k)+2}+D_{(t-k)+1}}{k(k+1)/2}$$\n",
        "> As an example, consider that the sales in January, February, March and April were 125 units, 142 units, 120 units, and 153 units, respectively. We want to forecast the demand for May using the weighted exponential method with $k=3$. Then the denominator will be $=3(3+1)/2 = 6$. The forecast is computed as $F_{May}=\\frac{3D_{April}+2D_{March}+1D_{Feb}}{6}=140.167 \\approx 140$\n",
