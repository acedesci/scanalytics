Your code can contain one or more lines and you can execute this cell in order to complete the exercise. To execute the cell, you can type `Shift+Enter` or press the play button in the toolbar above. Your results will appear right below this response cell.\n",

    "We can obtain $F(t)$ as a function of $p$ and $q$ as follows:\n",
