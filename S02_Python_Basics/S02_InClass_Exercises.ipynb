    "The EOQ model answer the question \"how much to order?\". The Reorder Point (ROP) tells \"when\" to order. ROP is introduced as the inventory level that signals when it is time to place an order. For example, ROP=1000 means that a new order should be placed as soon as the inventory on hand reaches 1000 units. \n",
