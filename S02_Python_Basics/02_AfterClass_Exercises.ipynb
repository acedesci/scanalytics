    "## Exercise 1: EOQ with discounts\n",

    "1. For each quantity range associated with a discount, calculate the quantity to optimal order Q* for that range based on the corresponding parameters using the EOQ equation;\n",
    "2. **If** Q* does not qualify for a discount, choose the smallest possible order size to get the discount and set Q* to that value, **otherwise** the value Q* remains unchanged;\n",
    "3. Calculate the total cost for each Q* from step 2;\n",
    "4. Select the Q* that gives the lowest total cost, which is calculated by. \n",

    "Please refer again to the detail of the Bass diffusion model in lecture. We have seen the calculation of the cumulative probability of adoption by an individual by time $t$: $F(t)$. Another number is the probability of adoption by an individual at time $t$ which is represented by $f(t)$ (recall that $f(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}F(t)$). \n",
